# React + Vite
This a task manager app that manages personal tasks and to-do lists. It includes features like categorization and due dates. This app uses a frontend framework like React along with a backend language like Node/Express. It equally contains user authentication and data storage in MongoDB.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
